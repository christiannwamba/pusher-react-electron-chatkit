A demo that shows how to use Pusher Chatkit and React in building a native desktop chat app. The native feature is powered by Electron.

## Setup

- Clone the repository
- Install all dependencies with `npm install`. This will take longer than normal because of the Electron scripts
- Start the auth server with `npm run server`
- Start the app with `npm run dev`.
